## Major Update: Experimental Features Merged Into Main

The **latest update** moves the majority of polished experimental branch features into the `main` branch!  
This means a more stable, refined experience for everyone with all the new goodies tested and ready.

This version also fixed the library errors. You must install the follwwing libraraies in the manager.
  
  "ArduinoJson" by Benoit Blanchon v7.3.0
  
  "Async TCP" by ESP32Async v3.4.7
  
  "ESP Async Webserver" by ESP32Async v3.7.1
  
  "LVGL" by kisvegabor v8.4.0

## File Compatibility & Streaming

A compatibility guide for supported media types, streaming expectations, and additional notes on performance.

| Category      | Supported Formats                    | Notes                                                                                   |
|---------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Video**     | `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.mkv`, `.webm`   | Reliable playback for these formats. `.avi` and `.flv` are **not supported**.           |
| **Audio**     | `.mp3`, `.flac`, `.wav`             | Other audio formats are **not supported** by the built-in player.                       |
| **Books / Docs** | `.pdf` (recommended), `.epub` (download only) | `.pdf` files can be opened and read directly in the browser. `.epub` files are downloadable but cannot be viewed in the built-in reader. |

**Important:** Nomad uses FAT32 storage by default, which limits individual file sizes to under 4 GB.

---

### Streaming Performance (Typical)

The following stream counts are based on a high endurance Grade 10 microSD card under ideal conditions:

| Resolution            | Typical Concurrent Streams |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| 480p                  | 6–8 streams                |
| 720p                  | 3–5 streams                |
| 1080p                 | 2–3 streams                |
| Ultra-HD / High bitrate| ~1 stream                  |

**Disclaimer:** Actual streaming performance varies depending on:  
- File encoding and bitrate  
- Network conditions  
- Client device capabilities  
- Number of simultaneous users  

Encoding video files using **H.264** video codec and **AAC** audio codec tends to improve streaming performance and allow more concurrent streams.

---


## Known Issues (Being Worked On)

- Large directories (80+ GB) can cause the admin file browser to crash when opened.  
- Some bugs remain with SD Card storage reading on both the Screen UI and the admin panel.

These issues are actively being addressed and will be fixed in upcoming releases.

---

## Future Plans

Here’s what’s coming next for Nomad:

- **Custom JS Content Players:**  
  Rebuild the video, audio, and ebook players with custom JavaScript libraries to enable:  
  - Better video support including multiple audio tracks and subtitles  
  - Proper EPUB support with in-browser reading  
  - CBX/CBZ comic book support with better navigation  

- **Custom Emojis and Icons:**  
  Devices currently recolor default emojis used in the UI inconsistently. Custom emojis/icons will provide consistent branding and better UX.

- **Advanced Caching System:**  
  A complex browser-side caching mechanism to:  
  - Track progress of media playback (movies, shows)  
  - Offer "resume where you left off" options for the last 5 watched items

## New Store and Promo Videos

You can now **buy your own Nomad Dev Kit** and get started immediately!  
The product is open source, but this saves you time and effort on assembly.

## What is Nomad

Jcorp Nomad is an open-source offline media server built for travel, remote work, classrooms, camping, and more. It runs entirely on an ESP32-S3 dev board, creates a local Wi-Fi hotspot, and serves media through a browser-accessible interface. It does not require internet access and works similarly to in-flight entertainment systems. It also allows multiple users watching seperate media streams at the same time. 

This project is designed to be compact, simple, and easily modifiable. It includes optional 3D-printable hardware and a fully open source firmware and web interface.

---

## Project Inspiration
This project was inspired by my experience running a Jellyfin server at home. I love having full control over my media library, and Jellyfin gave me everything I wanted > streaming movies, shows, books, and music, all from my own hardware. Naturally, I started looking for ways to take that experience on the go.

My first thought was to build a portable server, but I quickly ran into some major hurdles:

- Power-hungry hardware — Even low-power x86 boxes needed a hefty battery setup to stay running for long trips.

- High cost — SBCs like the Raspberry Pi 4, plus power banks, USB storage, and screen interfaces added up quickly.

- Heat and reliability — Trying to cram a full stack of services into a compact case often led to thermal issues and instability when running software meant for server hardware.

That’s when I pivoted.

Instead of replicating a full home media server, I focused on delivering the core experience:

- Offline access

- Local Wi-Fi hotspot

- Simple media browsing and playback

- Support for multiple users

The ESP32-S3 offered just enough performance to handle all of that - with a fraction of the power draw and cost.
The result is Nomad: a minimalist, reliable, and low-cost media server that delivers the essential features of a home streaming setup in a smaller than pocket sized format.

Is it fancy? No.
Does it work? Absolutely.
And it’s open-source, so anyone can expand, improve, and adapt it for their own needs.

## Hardware Requirements


- **Waveshare ESP32-S3 Dev Board (1.47" LCD version) with USBC for this fork**  

- **FAT32-formatted microSD card (16 GB minimum recommended, 64 GB preferred)**  

- **SD-Card Extender** Not needed, but useful for the latest case version, lets you get to the SD card without disasembly. 

- **USB power source** (e.g., battery bank or computer)

- **Optional:** 3D-printed enclosure (STL files included in the repository)

---

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO (to flash firmware)

All software used is free and available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

---

## Quick Start

1. Flash the ESP32-S3 with the firmware in the `/firmware/` directory.
2. Format your SD card as **FAT32** and copy the web files from `/SD_Card_Template/`.
3. Place your media files into the appropriate folders (see structure below).
4. Run `media.py` to generate `media.json` automatically.
5. Insert the SD card and power the device.
6. Connect to the Wi-Fi network named `NomadServer`.
7. Your browser will be redirected to the offline media interface.

## Future Plans

These are features I'd like to explore in future updates. If you'd like to contribute, feel free to fork the repo or open a pull request!


### Offline Maps with GPS Support
Inspired by [Backcountry Beacon](https://www.instructables.com/USB-Powered-Offline-Map-Server/), the goal is to serve cached map tiles and display the live GPS position from the user's phone or connected device — entirely offline.

### HTML5 Games
Similar to [Gams Offline](https://github.com/Gams-Offline/Gams), I would like to embed simple HTML5 games that work in-browser. The selection in Gams is amazing and make me think of cool math games, would be neat to have even though most require a keyboard.

### Audiobook-Friendly Mode
Improve playback for long-form audio by adding bookmarks, chapter display, and smart pause/resume. Intended for better audiobook handling in the Music section. Potentialy add an entire new audiobook section or a seperate handling system for it in books (Under read it could have a listen option).
